::: quote
No, no. Save your protests. You will tell me that you were only following the light of your god. You will plead for your life, tears in your eyes as you claim the truth of your sermons. You will beg for mercy and claim your heretical words were sacred. Do not bother. I believe you. And I do not care.

Where once life warred with death, knowledge with ignorance, and creation with destruction, the Pantheon arose to bring order to the divine. From the multitude of individual gods came twelve unified deities in whom all sanctioned concepts could exist in harmony. The major deities are the victors of this upheaval, called _the Syncretic Schism_. 

Where before many gods of life and healing would war with the many gods of death and mourning, now only one god held dominion over both life and death. Opposing concepts were brought into unity under each of the twelve gods of the Pantheon. For to hold thesis and antithesis, to control the raging fire and the quenching rain, is to wield divine power far beyond any traditional deity.

Only a few rebellious gods survived the Schism, minor divine beings who oppose the sanctified harmony of the Pantheon. And the gods of magic, purposefully kept divided and subjugated by the major deities so that no one god can wholly seize the power to manipulate reality.

Aporos does not forbid the research of pre-Schism history. Nevertheless, knowledge of this time is scarce. The scholar-priests of the Athenaeum-Sanctum have been unable to determine _when_ the Schism occurred. Ruins of temples to unknown deities have been found dating to thousands of years ago, yet, some village elders claim to recall when their church, once that of a singular God of Healing, was reconsecrated to The Cycle. When pressed further, these elders cannot remember the name of the deity they were raised to worship.

## Religious devotion

Gods are the creations of sapient beings. They are the natural occurence of [noetic residue concentrated by will](magic.html#the-formation-of-gods) by the prayers of countless mortals. Worship and faith are the precursors of divine power.

The nature of worship is such that certain affectations are given power through the influence they have over sapient minds. Runes carved into an altar, prayers sung in rhyme, or even blood-letting rituals in certain nations --- all of these can be used to channel belief into the divine realm. Some nations funnel resources into glorious temples with gilded altars in the belief that wealth empowers prayer. There is nothing inherently mystical about rituals and architecture, but they serve as focii for the mortal mind because they are believed to hold power.

In order to receive such worship the gods must be seen as active. Deities prefer not to directly impose the full brunt of their will upon the world, for the mortal realm is fragile under the hands of divine power, and divine presence can shatter the film between reality and [the Noetic Wasterealm](magic.html#the-noetic-wasterealm). But they do act through their churches and mortal followers, and can occasionally intervene in subtle, careful ways. Quo may guide the dice of a gambler, shifting reality ever so slightly, or The Chains That Bind may weaken the shackles of a convicted murderer so that he might escape the hangman's noose.

Intervention is a delicate matter. The major deities maintain a careful balance of their opposing domains. Every answered prayer for healing tips the scales of life and death, and so The Cycle must impose a corresponding element of death upon the world. Thus, to beg the the gods to preserve the life of a loved one is to also plead for death for a stranger.

Petitionary prayer is a significant act for mortals. Only desperate, reckless, or indifferent people will request the direct intervention of a deity, for they understand that the balancing consequences can be significant. Most prayer is for thanks, guidance, or to form a lasting connection with a deity.

The gods prefer to intervene indirectly through mortal followers. Unfocused divine energy channelled through the mortal will of a cleric is not at risk of upsetting the balance of The Pantheon in the same way that direct intervention would be. In most regions, organised religion tends to be the most powerful way for the gods to influence the world.

## Sins and morality

The gods do not care for the petty concerns of morality. Murder, theft, betrayal --- these are all a part of the Pantheon's purview. Why should the God of Life and Death care whether death is by illness or by a dagger in the back? Such matters are for the ethics of people, not the divine. Even blasphemy is of no concern, for those who scorn a god must still acknowledge it, granting divine focus.

The major deities care only for acts that challenge their status. The gods ultimately derive their power from mortals, and in sufficient numbers mortals can alter the composition of the divine. Certain deities represent domains that challenge the divine status quo --- domains the Pantheon could not absorb during the Syncretic Schism. The Pantheon declares these gods _transgressive_ and forbids their worship as heresy that challenges the divine order.

It is rare that the Pantheon will intervene directly to prevent such worship, however. Such is the power of the major deities that placing their divine hand upon the world risks an ingress of raw [noetic residue](magic.html#noetic-residue) upon reality. The gods prefer to act through their churches and mortal followers where possible, saving direct intervention for only the most serious of threats. 

### The ultimate sin of diremption

The most profane act that any mortal can take against the major deities is to attempt to split them into two. The strength and authority of the Pantheon is due to their contradictory domains, for each god is given sovereignty over a concept of existence and its antithesis. Should enough mortal devotion be directed to only one half of a major deity's domain, then that god could be weakened or even sundered into two.

The Pantheon therefore view any attempt to worship only one of their domains as sacrilege. This is the sin above all sins, the act of _diremption_. Should enough misguided worshippers gather in a single place, the Pantheon may even intervene directly in a rare demonstration of their power upon the mortal world. Such an event is recorded in [in the history of The Triune Duchy](the-triune-duchy.html#the-diremption-of-the-cycle).

Priests and lay people will take great care to always acknowledge both aspects of a major diety in their devotions. The artist who beseeches The Herald of Flame for inspiration must first acknowledge the deity's role as a destructive force, for to separate creation and destruction is to challenge the divine order. 

## The divine landscape

### The Pantheon

The most powerful deities embody a concept and its antithesis. Even the smallest of villages in the Veil will have an altar to The Cycle in a makeshift church in the centre of town, and larger cities will keep space for twelve grand temples.

| [Our Grace](#our-grace) | Nature & Civilisation | Oak Leaf |

### The sanctioned gods of magic

Magic is a terrifying prospect to the gods, being the means to enact their agenda and but also harbouring the potential for destruction. Mortal mages burn the fuel of [noetic residue](magic.html#noetic-residue) in the furnace of their will to change reality itself. To limit the ability of mages, the Pantheon did not subsume the god of magic during the Syncretic Schism. Instead of allowing any one deity to wield the power of magic, they sundered the Moon God into six.

Four of the aspects of magic were sanctioned by the Pantheon, and the other two --- that of necromancy and divination --- were to be erased from existence. The Eclipsed Moon of necromancy stood in opposition to The Cycle, and the Halo Moon of Divination was an affront to Aporos, for the Athenaeum-Sanctum decries all knowledge won without teaching,

Yet the Pantheon, despite their new might, could not unravel these aspects from creation. Their very nature was somehow fundamental to reality, and to the mortals on whom the major deities depended upon for worship.

| Name | Domain | Symbol |
|------|--------|--------|
| [The New Moon](#the-new-moon) | Magic (transmutation, creation) | White circle with black interior |
| [The Waxing Moon](#the-waxing-moon) | Magic (abjuration, conjuration) | White crescent moon illuminated on the left |
| [The Full Moon](#the-full-moon) | Magic (enchantment, destruction) | White circle with white interior |
| [The Waning Moon](#the-waning-moon) | Magic (illusion, curses) | White crescent moon illuminated on the right |

### The transgressive gods

These deities stand in opposition to the major pantheon, not because their domains are necessarily evil, but because they are conceptually incompatible with that of a major god. Undeath cannot coexist within the balance of Life & Death, and so The Awakened is a threat to The Cycle. 

These gods persist because there will always be worshippers who seek them out. There will always be a grieving mage who will turn to The Halo Moon out of desperation for a departed loved one. Perhaps this is why these gods survived the Syncretic Schism, for they appeal to a part of the human soul that the Pantheon could not suppress. They are as natural to the world as the domains of the major gods, but any challenge to the divine order cannot be tolerated.

The Pantheon instead suppresses worship of the transgressive gods. Unwilling to act directly, for their immense power could break the skeins of reality, and knowing that these minor gods can never truly be erased from existence, the major deities instead rely on their mortal followers to enforce the prohibition against worshipping these beings.

Undeath is a persistent force in Woadveil. Wayward mages who pray to The Eclipsed Moon can glimpse the secrets of necromancy, but this is not the only means of bringing the dead back into the world of the living. The undead are a natural phenomenon and their patron deity is The Awakened, who watches over every shambling ghoul.

| Name | Domain | Symbol |
|------|--------|--------|
| [The Awakened](#the-awakened) | Undeath | Skull |
| [The Eclipsed Moon](#the-eclipsed-moon) | Magic (necromancy) | Red circle |
| [The Halo Moon](#the-halo-moon) | Magic (divination) | White circle with white interior encircled by a white ring |
| [The Untimely](#the-untimely) | Temporal Manipulation |  |
| [The Unravelling Thread](#the-unravelling-thread) | Void |  |
