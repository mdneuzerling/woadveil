No, no. Save your protests. You will tell me that you were only following the light of your god. You will plead for your life, tears in your eyes as you claim the truth of your sermons. You will beg for mercy and claim your heretical words were sacred. Do not bother. I believe you. And I do not care.

Where once life warred with death, knowledge with ignorance, and creation with destruction, the Pantheon arose to bring order to the divine. From the multitude of individual gods came twelve unified deities in whom all sanctioned concepts could exist in harmony. The major deities are the victors of this upheaval, called _the Syncretic Schism_. 

Where before many gods of life and healing would war with the many gods of death and mourning, now only one god held dominion over both life and death. Opposing concepts were brought into unity under each of the twelve gods of the Pantheon. For to hold thesis and antithesis, to control the raging fire and the quenching rain, is to wield divine power far beyond any traditional deity.

Only a few rebellious gods survived the Schism, minor divine beings who oppose the sanctified harmony of the Pantheon. And the gods of magic, purposefully kept divided and subjugated by the major deities so that no one god can wholly seize the power to manipulate reality.

Aporos does not forbid the research of pre-Schism history. Nevertheless, knowledge of this time is scarce. The scholar-priests of the Athenaeum-Sanctum have been unable to determine _when_ the Schism occurred. Ruins of temples to unknown deities have been found dating to thousands of years ago, yet, some village elders claim to recall when their church, once that of a singular God of Healing, was reconsecrated to The Cycle. When pressed further, these elders cannot remember the name of the deity they were raised to worship.

## Religious devotion

Gods are the creations of sapient beings. They are the natural occurence of [noetic residue concentrated by will](magic.html#the-formation-of-gods) by the prayers of countless mortals. Worship and faith are the precursors of divine power.

The nature of worship is such that certain affectations are given power through the influence they have over sapient minds. Runes carved into an altar, prayers sung in rhyme, or even blood-letting rituals in certain nations --- all of these can be used to channel belief into the divine realm. Some nations funnel resources into glorious temples with gilded altars in the belief that wealth empowers prayer. There is nothing inherently mystical about rituals and architecture, but they serve as focii for the mortal mind because they are believed to hold power.

In order to receive such worship the gods must be seen as active. Deities prefer not to directly impose the full brunt of their will upon the world, for the mortal realm is fragile under the hands of divine power, and divine presence can shatter the film between reality and [the Noetic Wasterealm](magic.html#the-noetic-wasterealm). But they do act through their churches and mortal followers, and can occasionally intervene in subtle, careful ways. Quo may guide the dice of a gambler, shifting reality ever so slightly, or The Chains That Bind may weaken the shackles of a convicted murderer so that he might escape the hangman's noose.

Intervention is a delicate matter. The major deities maintain a careful balance of their opposing domains. Every answered prayer for healing tips the scales of life and death, and so The Cycle must impose a corresponding element of death upon the world. Thus, to beg the the gods to preserve the life of a loved one is to also plead for death for a stranger.

Petitionary prayer is a significant act for mortals. Only desperate, reckless, or indifferent people will request the direct intervention of a deity, for they understand that the balancing consequences can be significant. Most prayer is for thanks, guidance, or to form a lasting connection with a deity.

The gods prefer to intervene indirectly through mortal followers. Unfocused divine energy channelled through the mortal will of a cleric is not at risk of upsetting the balance of The Pantheon in the same way that direct intervention would be. In most regions, organised religion tends to be the most powerful way for the gods to influence the world.

## Sins and morality

The gods do not care for the petty concerns of morality. Murder, theft, betrayal --- these are all a part of the Pantheon's purview. Why should the God of Life and Death care whether death is by illness or by a dagger in the back? Such matters are for the ethics of people, not the divine. Even blasphemy is of no concern, for those who scorn a god must still acknowledge it, granting divine focus.

The major deities care only for acts that challenge their status. The gods ultimately derive their power from mortals, and in sufficient numbers mortals can alter the composition of the divine. Certain deities represent domains that challenge the divine status quo --- domains the Pantheon could not absorb during the Syncretic Schism. The Pantheon declares these gods _transgressive_ and forbids their worship as heresy that challenges the divine order.

It is rare that the Pantheon will intervene directly to prevent such worship, however. Such is the power of the major deities that placing their divine hand upon the world risks an ingress of raw [noetic residue](magic.html#noetic-residue) upon reality. The gods prefer to act through their churches and mortal followers where possible, saving direct intervention for only the most serious of threats. 

### The ultimate sin of diremption

The most profane act that any mortal can take against the major deities is to attempt to split them into two. The strength and authority of the Pantheon is due to their contradictory domains, for each god is given sovereignty over a concept of existence and its antithesis. Should enough mortal devotion be directed to only one half of a major deity's domain, then that god could be weakened or even sundered into two.

The Pantheon therefore view any attempt to worship only one of their domains as sacrilege. This is the sin above all sins, the act of _diremption_. Should enough misguided worshippers gather in a single place, the Pantheon may even intervene directly in a rare demonstration of their power upon the mortal world. Such an event is recorded in [in the history of The Triune Duchy](the-triune-duchy.html#the-diremption-of-the-cycle).

Priests and lay people will take great care to always acknowledge both aspects of a major diety in their devotions. The artist who beseeches Apogenesis for inspiration must first acknowledge the deity's role as a destructive force, for to separate creation and destruction is to challenge the divine order. 

## The divine landscape

### The Pantheon

The most powerful deities embody a concept and its antithesis. Even the smallest of villages in the Veil will have an altar to The Cycle in a makeshift church in the centre of town, and larger cities will keep space for twelve grand temples.

### The sanctioned gods of magic

Magic is a terrifying prospect to the gods, being the means to enact their agenda and but also harbouring the potential for destruction. Mortal mages burn the fuel of [noetic residue](magic.html#noetic-residue) in the furnace of their will to change reality itself. To limit the ability of mages, the Pantheon did not subsume the god of magic during the Syncretic Schism. Instead of allowing any one deity to wield the power of magic, they sundered the Moon God into six.

Four of the aspects of magic were sanctioned by the Pantheon, and the other two --- that of necromancy and divination --- were to be erased from existence. The Eclipsed Moon of necromancy stood in opposition to The Cycle, and the Halo Moon of Divination was an affront to Aporos, for the Athenaeum-Sanctum decries all knowledge won without teaching,

Yet the Pantheon, despite their new might, could not unravel these aspects from creation. Their very nature was somehow fundamental to reality, and to the mortals on whom the major deities depended upon for worship.

| Name | Domain | Symbol |
|------|--------|--------|
| [The New Moon](#the-new-moon) | Magic (transmutation, creation) | White circle with black interior |
| [The Waxing Moon](#the-waxing-moon) | Magic (abjuration, conjuration) | White crescent moon illuminated on the left |
| [The Full Moon](#the-full-moon) | Magic (enchantment, destruction) | White circle with white interior |
| [The Waning Moon](#the-waning-moon) | Magic (illusion, curses) | White crescent moon illuminated on the right |

### The transgressive gods

These deities stand in opposition to the major pantheon, not because their domains are necessarily evil, but because they are conceptually incompatible with that of a major god. Undeath cannot coexist within the balance of Life & Death, and so The Awakened is a threat to The Cycle. 

These gods persist because there will always be worshippers who seek them out. There will always be a grieving mage who will turn to The Halo Moon out of desperation for a departed loved one. Perhaps this is why these gods survived the Syncretic Schism, for they appeal to a part of the human soul that the Pantheon could not suppress. They are as natural to the world as the domains of the major gods, but any challenge to the divine order cannot be tolerated.

The Pantheon instead suppresses worship of the transgressive gods. Unwilling to act directly, for their immense power could break the skeins of reality, and knowing that these minor gods can never truly be erased from existence, the major deities instead rely on their mortal followers to enforce the prohibition against worshipping these beings.

Undeath is a persistent force in Woadveil. Wayward mages who pray to The Eclipsed Moon can glimpse the secrets of necromancy, but this is not the only means of bringing the dead back into the world of the living. The undead are a natural phenomenon and their patron deity is The Awakened, who watches over every shambling ghoul.

| Name | Domain | Symbol |
|------|--------|--------|
| [The Awakened](#the-awakened) | Undeath | Skull |
| [The Eclipsed Moon](#the-eclipsed-moon) | Magic (necromancy) | Red circle |
| [The Halo Moon](#the-halo-moon) | Magic (divination) | White circle with white interior encircled by a white ring |
| [The Untimely](#the-untimely) | Temporal Manipulation |  |
| [The Unravelling Thread](#the-unravelling-thread) | Void |  |

:::entity-content-left
:::entity-text
The head of the Pantheon with dominion over births, deaths, childcare, healing, mourning, murder, and burials. The Cycle is a sombre god who approaches her duties with professionalism.

Every celebration of a life and commemoration of death honours The Cycle. She is worshipped by barber surgeons and assassins alike, who recognise her as the arbiter of mortality.

In The Triune Duchy The Church of The Cycle is wealthier than any other due to its exactions on healing and burial rites. Sick nobles turn to the balance-priests of The Cycle for aid, and in desperation offer generous bequests. For this reason the Church controls more land than any noble apart from the dukes themselves.

Her pigment is terra rosa. Balance-priests of The Cycle wear round clothing of terra rosa with gold embellishments. Her holy days are the equinoxes. Worshippers in The Pale Vein honour The Cycle on birthdays as a celebration of life and a reminder of mortality.

:::entity-content-right
:::entity-text
In the courtrooms of the Triune Duchy, the family of the victim pray for justice. In the dungeon cells below, the accused prays for exoneration. Both prayers are considered by Mercy, the god of order, rebellion, justice, revolts, governance, and anarchy. Older texts refer to him as "The Son", although it's not clear to whom this relationship is held, for gods sire no children.

A kind god, or as benevolent a deity can be given their parasitic nature, he loves the accused and aggrieved alike. He is equally worshipped by acts of considered justice and impulsive vengeance, deference to one's superiors and challenge of established rule. In The Triune Duchy his magistrate-priests administer the courts, charging nobles for the settlement of disputes and the administration of justice on their behalf.

Her pigment is terra rosa. Balance-priests of The Cycle wear clothing with rounded shapes and dyed with terra rosa, and with gold embellishments. Her holy days are the solstices. Worshippers in The Pale Vein honour The Cycle on birthdays as a celebration of life and a reminder of mortality.

<div class="entity-subtitle">Protection & Conquest</div>
</div>

:::entity-content-left
:::entity-text
Leaders of every nation and tribe pray for the conquest of their foes and protection from approaching armies. The Fractured God hears prayers from all sides. Imagined in every nation as a warrior bearing the vestments of the warrior class, the Fractured God is so-called for its incoherent image. At once a single entity and a thousand tribal gods, this deity has dominion over military matters, as well as protection of home and hearth.

Honoured by military discipline, petty land grabs and locked doors, The Fractured God is frequently invoked by those marching into danger. In The Triune Duchy its battle-priests train and minister the armies of the realm, and exacts fees from the nobility in exchange for this religious service.

Their pigment is raw umber, but this is the only constant across the various depictions of The Fractured God. Each nation and tribe will interpret the deity as one of their own, with raw umber set against the garments and colours of that group's warriors. While some acknowledge the fractured nature of the deity, it's also common for the god to take on regional names. In The Pale Vein, warriors each wear a small worm-ivory carving of The Fractured God tied to their clothes to recognise their role as defenders of the tribe.

</div>

:::entity-content-right
:::entity-text
She sanctifies the signing of contracts and rejoices in their breaking. She is rigid, scrupulous, and pedantic. She is Persona, the god of truth, deception, oaths and records.

Her church in The Triune Duchy plays the role of a formal witness in the religious affairs of other deities. Her witness-priests will make an official record of a wedding ceremony of The Twin Flame, or hear testimony in a court of Mercy.

A witness-priest may also process a formal renunciation of an alliance or the forsaking of a trade agreement. There is no judgment of the oath-breaker in the eyes of Persona, for truth and deception are alike in her domain, but all broken oaths must be lodged in the record halls of the Church.

Her pigment is ivory black, in recognition of the ink used to record truths and lies. In The Pale Vein, semi-nomadic tribes are limited in what books they can carry, and written records are reserved for only the most important histories. Instead, her worship is through the act of passing down stories orally.

:::entity-content-left
:::entity-text
Worshipped not as a being but as a force, Apogenesis is the conceptual embodiment of creation, destruction and inspiration. It is honoured by artists, craftspeople, musicians and miners.

The mandala-priests of Apogenesis are known for their elaborate mandalas, drawn in the sand over many days of intense prayer. When no unmarked sand remains, the mandala-priests clap their hands in unison, and rake over the patterns to begin again.

In The Triune Duchy, the Church of Apogenesis is wealthy through its sponsorship of various craft guilds. The Church's paladins ruthlessly suppress any attempts to set up a market stall without the blessings of the relevant guild, for a portion of all guild fees makes its way into Church coffers.

</div>

:::entity-content-right
:::entity-text
A proud deity, The Chains That Bind is the god of freedom, bondage, duty, obligation, and law enforcement. Appealed to by slave and slave owner alike, The Chains That Bind is honoured by any act of liberation or constraint. He is the manacles on a prisoner's wrists, and the key that unlocks them.

In The Triune Duchy the mediator-priests of the Church of The Chains That Bind take an active role in the law enforcement of towns and cities, and charge the nobles for the privilege. The clergy view their role as essential in keeping civilisation running and, unlike the laypeople who make up the bulk of the town guards, are above bribery and undue influence. The mediator-priests are not concerned with matters of justice, for that is of the domain of Mercy; as long as criminals are in chains then they view their job as a success.

</div>

:::entity-content-left
:::entity-text
While no mortal can ever truly understand a god, there are none so opaque as Aporos, the god of knowledge, ignorance, research, and forgetfulness. It is they who decide the boundaries of the so-called "sea of knowledge", where mortals may only know what is held above the surface of ignorance, and are never to swim into the forbidden lore below. To glimpse knowledge meant only for the divine is an _apocraphism_ in the eyes of Aporos, a sin against the limits of mortal ken.

Only by Aporos's blessing can research be undertaken, but it is not clear what remains open to mortal research and what is forbidden. The scholar-priests of the Athenaeum-Colleges, the temples of the Church of Aporos, determine the answer by arcane methods. Novices study the practice of _echymomancy_, reading the bruising and swelling of corpses, to determine the sanctioned areas of mortal knowledge. Some theorise that complete knowledge of the limitations of human knowledge is itself forbidden.

Despite the severity of the sin of apocraphism, The Church does not punish laypeople for obtaining forbidden knowledge, for how could the untrained hope to navigate the sea of knowledge? It tends to those who have glimpsed what should not be known as a caring nurse to a patient, offering the _Healing of Unknowing_. The patient is granted freedom from forbidden knowledge, amongst other things.

:::entity-text
She hears the vows of newlyweds and delights in adultery. She is whimsical and mischievous, a romantic and a bitter enemy. She is The Twin Flame, the god of love, hatred, friendship, revelry, passion, and rivalry.

Her church in The Triune Duchy is one of the poorest, though still wealthier than most nobles. It is known for its monopoly on wines and ales, with vineyards tended by the celebrant-priests of The Twin Flame. The recipes and techniques of these beverages are a guarded secret that many have claimed to steal over the centuries. Yet whenever one of these stolen recipes is enacted, the result is an ashen beverage tasting of sulfur and rancid fish.

:::entity-content-left
:::entity-text
Beloved by bankers and despised by the bankrupt, Quo is the god of prosperity, loss, wealth, and poverty. A fickle deity, he favours a business one day and plots against it the next. Any trader who wishes to see profit must pay tribute to Quo or risk attracting his ire, and even that is often insufficient, for his favour is ever capricious.

In The Triune Duchy, the usury-priests of the Church of Quo offer banking services to nobles and wealthy common folk. There are few who willingly visit these holy places of money lending and safe keeping, for most prefer to avoid the gaze of Quo.

The usury-priests are skilled at forecasting the mercurial moods of Quo. Divination magic is strictly forbidden, so these forecasts are based on more mundane methods such as mathematical predictions and the interpretation of dreams. Anxious investors purchase these forecasts in a futile attempt to navigate the shifting markets.

:::entity-text
Worshipped not as a being but as a force, Acquiescence is the abandonment of agency to fate. It is the god of hope, despair, optimism and pessimism alike, as well as luck, fate, and gambling. All mortal beings turn to Acquiescence at some point in their lives, in sheer desperation when it seems that no more can be done. It is the hand on the scales that makes one outcome more likely than another.

Even in The Triune Duchy, worship of Acquiescence is informal, with few temples outside of cities and major towns. The fate-priests of the Church maintain more gambling dens than formal places of worship. A citizen of the Duchy can lose everything at one of these holy casinos, but the games are never rigged, for Acquiescence always leaves things to chance.

All deities are born of aggregate mortal consciousness, yet none represent the collective as much as Our Inheritance, the god of nature, civilisation, the wilds and urbanisation. They are the personification of our extraction from, and obligations to, the commons.

In The Triune Duchy, the heritage-priests of the Church of Our Inheritance minister access to pastures, fishing areas, the hunting of game and the collection of wood. The fees gathered in exchange for this access discourage overconsumption of common resources, while also keeping the Church coffers full. Church paladins ruthlessly enforce these restrictions, and anyone caught so much as trapping rabbits without the necessary permits is dealt with swiftly.

:::entity-text
The Path Before Us is the god of change, stagnation, and time. They are often worshipped by the agrarian class, for whom the seasons are so important. For this reason the deity has acquired an additional domain as the god of agriculture, and are viewed fondly by peasants.

In The Triune Duchy their ruminate-priests are meditative and detached, seeking to accept the world as it is, yet also as it could be. Those experiencing grief or sadness often seek out the Church of The Path Before Us to meditate with the clergy. For a price, pilgrims can hear the blessed words of acceptance and resilience, before being sent on their way to return to the source of their troubles.
