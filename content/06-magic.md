_Magic_ is the will of mortals manifest upon the laws of reality. It is the defiance of gravity, the creation of something from nothing, and the placement of effect before cause. A mage has the power to close the distance between the world as it is, and the world as they wish it to be.

## Noetic residue

Despite its wonderful nature, magic is often understood through scientific enterprise. The Lunar-Sanctum of the Four Moons teaches that, just as humans inhale and exhale, sapient thought itself yields a waste product, called _noetic residue_. Less refined mages call it _waste_ or _effluence_. It is the excrement of the cognitive process, the tailings of emotion and dreams, that is collected by a skilled mage and burnt in the furnace of their will to create magical effects.

The mage-scholars of the Lunar-Sanctum learn to tap into this power through academic study and careful analysis. Theirs is a reasoned approach, treating magic as science, and no more unnatural than the tides. They call the act of performing magic _channelling_, although the colloquial term of _burning_ noetic residue is far more commonplace.

Others can burn noetic waste without the rigour of academia. Clerics of religious deities gain the ability to access noetic residue through their deities. Some make pacts with otherworldly beings. A rare few are born with the innate ability to focus their will to burn effluence, although few such people make it to adulthood; the power they wield as children makes them a threat to their community, and many are dealt with by fearful neighbours.

Beneath the pretension of the Lunar-Sanctum, all acts of magic are the same underlying process --- the combustion of thought-waste in the focused will of a sapient being. And will is the key, for noetic waste is abundant. It is only the mage's ability to tap into that well that determines their ability to alter reality.

## The Noetic Wasterealm

Noetic residue doesn't exist within the material world, but gathers instead within the _Noetic Wasterealm_, often called _The Waste_. There is no concept of distance in this realm, and it is meaningless to talk about the "density" of noetic residue. A mage in a desert far from civilisation has as much access to noetic residue as they would in the middle of a crowded city.

The lack of meaningful physics is exploited by skilled mages to travel great distances in an instant. A particular magical talent goes beyond tapping into reserves of noetic waste and allows physical entry into the waste, a realm that does not usually permit physical matter. Once inside, the mage "closes the door", severing their connection to the physical realm, and entering a state of “noetic dissolution”. They then open a portal to the physical realm near their target destination, becoming corporeal once more.

The truth of the process is not so simple. Noetic dissolution is a precarious state, and the traveller of The Waste must take great care not to lose their self amongst the cacophonous rapture of noetic residue. Every skilled traveller develops their own technique to maintain coherenct identity during passage. The moment of noetic dissolution is a thousand chances to lose one's sense of self to the undifferentiated thought-excrement of countless strangers.

## Amalgams

Noetic residue is not coherent thought. It is the collected and diffuse tailings of thoughts, emotions, and dreams of every sapient being. It is meaningless, like the overlapping conversations of a crowded marketplace, with only the occasional word overheard and devoid of context.

Noetic dissolution exposes the mortal psyche to a pressure of egos, each incoherent in itself but together crushing in its collective force. Such exposure can permanently dissolve the barriers that allow individuals to maintain their sense of self.

The damage of minor direct exposure to the Noetic Wasterealm can be healed. Given time, the psyche can reject the presence of foreign thought. But too much at once, or too much over time, can overwhelm even the strongest of minds.

The effects may not be noticed immediately. Over days or weeks the person's sense of self erodes, and is replaced by fragments of thought absorbed in The Waste. The overlapping fragments of noetic intrusions often lead to an incoherent personality, but sometimes a consensus emerges and a new person is born --- an _amalgam_.

This cannot be undone. Amalgams cannot be healed because there is nothing to heal — the person is not broken, they are someone else. Potentially hundreds or even thousands of someone elses.

Yet there is a boon to be gained from such a tragedy, for amalgams are said to hold knowledge lost to time.

## Noetic sickness

Noetic residue is filth, and its combustion leaves a stain upon a mage. The cost of magic is _noetic sickness_, the lingering maladies that remain after the burning of effluence. 

The initial effects are psychological --- stray thoughts that are not the mage's own, or new affectations and mannerisms. These fade in minutes. But should the mage continue to burn noetic residue before recovering, then the physical symptoms begin. The mage experience tremors, vacant stares, and rapid shifts in temperature. 

For the most part, noetic sickness is short-term and manageable. The psyche reasserts itself against the fumes of channelling. As mages hone their craft, they are able to burn greater amounts of noetic residue without escalating symptoms. In moments of true desperation, mages can reach for magic beyond their aptitude. This is when noetic sickness can be devastating.

The mage can find themselves having forgotten their native language, instead speaking the tongue of a land they've never visited. Colours could be replaced with sounds, or the mage could feel searing pain whenever they see a wild animal. The effects are unpredictable and occasionally permanent.

Mages of the Lunar-Sanctum are taught to respect the limits of their abilities, and never to reach beyond the 

## The formation of gods

Noetic residue is thought-waste, and carries with it only a lingering sense of the thought that bore it. But just as mages draw on noetic waste to alter reality, the Noetic Wasterealm can be guided by sapient thought. _Worship_ is a powerful lens that can focus the effluence of the Waste into coherent concepts of great power. These are the beings that mortals call [deities](deities.html).

Deities, while dependent on the worship of mortals, are independent beings. They have limited power outside the bounds of their conceptual domains. But the boundaries between conceptual domains are vague, for how is a god of life distinct from a god of healing? And gods, being born of mortal thought, are as power-hungry as any human. The divine landscape is ever-changing, with gods stealing power from other gods, or casting each other into oblivion.

Gods can be killed. Deicide demands that the human worshippers of a god redirect their worship towards another, for while concepts cannot be erased from existence, the divine composition is far more malleable. Power-hungry deities can influence the mortal realm in subtle ways, directing belief where they desire and eliminating competition. Heresy is but a contrivance of jealous gods.
