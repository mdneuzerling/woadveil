Woadveil is a realm where opposites coexist in uneasy truce. Above stretches the Veil, where peasants work the farms and magic is restricted to the wealthy few. Deep underground spans the Woad, where magic and dangerous beasts are commonplace.

Some secretly wonder how the realm came to be.

The Athenaeum-Colleges of Aporos reject the question. The origin of the world either cannot be known, or should not be known by mortals. Enquiry into the matter by laypeople is an Apocraphism that can be treated with the Healing of Unknowing.

The Heretical Church of the Unravelling Thread believes that Woadveil is the shattered avatar of the Unified God, and only by unmaking the world can mortals live in unity with the True Deity. 

The Wandering Prophet Zazanelle preaches that the world is dead, and that Woadveil is its last breath --- an echo of existence that is doomed to fade away, along with its inhabitants.
